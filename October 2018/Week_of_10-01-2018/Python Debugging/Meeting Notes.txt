We primarily covered the following rules for debugging:
	1) when googling, preface your search with the module name that you are using
		e.g. "pandas <insert error from terminal here>"
	2) stick to stackoverflow.com answers as much as you can, dont get lost in documentation
	3) find examples of code in use, as opposed to single line answers
		BUT dont read any answer thats more than 5-10 lines long - thats a waste of time
	4) many errors have the same solutions, so if you find an answer with the same error but in a different
		context, dont be afraid to use that as your solution
	5) if you cant find an answer easily, look for another way to do things
